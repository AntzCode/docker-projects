# Recipes to use with Docker Compose

To install a recipe, navigate to the folder with your console and run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

* Note: if a recipe has additional configuration, that will be explained in the recipe's README.md file.

See further documentation at [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
